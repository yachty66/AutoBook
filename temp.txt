Chapter 2: "The Berlin Experiment: A New Beginning"

Topic 1: Liam's transition to life in Berlin and the setup of his lab

From the instant he disembarked from the plane, Liam absorbed Berlin like a sponge. He enjoyed the cultural vibrancy, the futuristic vibe and the innovative spirit pervading every corner of the city. The atmosphere was far removed from his small town in the Netherlands, but it echoed with the promise of the future Liam had always dreamed of building. However, it also represented a daunting challenge that he was keen to overcome.

His first stop was his new abode – a loft-style apartment on the outskirts of Berlin. It was sparse but spacious, providing the ideal canvas for the working space he envisaged. He started building his lab, which would be both his hiding spot from the world and the sanctuary where he would make history. 

The room at the far end of the apartment was designated to be his lab. It attracted him because of the natural light it received from the skylight and the large windows overlooking the Berlin skyline. Just as he had done with computer code when he was a child, Liam began to shape his new environment into a space that mirrored his ambitions.

He worked tirelessly over the subsequent weeks, transforming what was once an empty room into a well-equipped lab. His tools were his guiding stars amidst the sea of equipment - a high-speed computer to run cognitive simulations, a state-of-the-art microscope for detailed neuron analysis, shelves teeming with neuroscience literature, and a plethora of software and hardware tools that were scarcely comprehensible to the common eye but held a familiar charm for the young coder.

As not to entirely abandon his Dutch roots, he also built a small corner dedicated to his bedroom in the Netherlands, placing photographs and trinkets symbolizing his past life — every reminder infusing him with the strength to surmount the challenges of his new life in Berlin.

On one side of the room, a massive whiteboard stretched from the floor to the ceiling, where Liam planned to pen down his theories and ideas. However, the whiteboard remained blank for weeks. The hasty departure from the Netherlands and the zeal to get everything prepared had caused an unsettling silence in Liam's mind. The ideas that once rushed like an untamed river seemed to have deserted him, making him question whether he'd been right to move to Berlin in the first place.

Shrugging off his doubts as an effect of the exhaustion, he gave himself permission to reset. He’d started coding at a young age, showing a natural talent for it. As he lay in his unfamiliar bed, a sense of calm washed over him as he remembered the rush of joy from seeing lines of code translate into functional processes. It was this passion that had brought him to Berlin, given him the courage to leave his familiar life behind. He found solace in that memory and woke up the next day with renewed energy, ready to take on his new world.

The blank whiteboard was filled with equations and diagrams by the end of the day. His neuroenhancement projects, once mere figments of his imagination, were starting to take form in his new lab. The initial silence had scared him, but the city's energy and the lab's potential had inspired his creativity. Today, Liam stands at the threshold of his remarkable journey into cognitive enhancement, undaunted by the challenges that lie ahead, ready to reshape the world as we know it. His life in Berlin is just taking off, each day a new lesson, a new experiment, a new leap toward the future he envisions.
