Chapter 1: "The Dutch Prodigy: A Childhood in the Netherlands"

Liam Van Der Berg was born and raised in the flat, picturesque landscapes of the Netherlands, in the city of Utrecht, known for its vibrant cultural life and beautiful canals. The home he was brought up in was one dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge, instilled with a deep respect for education and learning. His parents, both university professors, provided an intellectually stimulating environment that significantly shaped Liam's formative years.

His father, Professor Johan Van Der Berg was a highly-respected authority in the field of Computer Science, while his mother, Professor Irene Van Der Berg was a renowned scholar in the field of Philosophy. This unique combination of academic influences allowed Liam an early insight into the world of logic, reasoning, computational thinking, and ethics. Household discussions often transcended mundane topics, covering complex computer algorithms, philosophical debates, and theoretical concepts.

Liam was encouraged to ask questions, to think critically, to learn, unlearn, and relearn. His parents' shared belief in the power of education instilled a profound sense of intellectual curiosity in him, an attribute that contributed significantly to his propensity towards knowledge and innovation.

Liam's early exposure to computers and science started almost as soon as he could walk and talk, and certainly before he could read. His father’s home office was a playground of exploration, filled with computers, gadgets, textbooks and research papers. By the age of four, he was already familiar with the basic components of a computer. His father, recognizing his son’s keen interest, willingly spent hours explaining the complex codes on his screen to young Liam, instilling in him an early fascination with the digital world.

The frequency of these father-son interactions increased with time, gradually becoming learning sessions where complex problems would be discussed and ideas exchanged. These interactions marked the initiation of Liam into the world of computers and science, propelling him on a path that would eventually lead him to his destiny. This childhood environment, filled with intellectual discussions, scientific exploration, and uncapped discovery, laid the foundation for the extraordinary journey that Liam was yet to embark upon.

From an early age, it was evident that Liam was different, his parents’ wisdom had fostered a prodigy, and his story serves as a testament to 

the power of childhood influences in shaping one's life trajectory. His life was a testament to the chord struck by the fledgling combination of an enquiring mind, a conducive environment, and the right guidance. This early formulation created the foundation of a deep bond between Liam and his scientific pursuits, a bond that would only grow stronger with time.

Growing up, while other kids played soccer or watched cartoons, Liam was found poring over his father’s computer or engrossed in the new coding language he was learning. Much of his free time was spent exploring different scientific experiments that he could try out at home, making educational software, and dreaming about future technological advances. It was evident, even then, that Liam was destined for great things. This childhood passion for science and technology had sown the seeds of an idea that would take root and bloom in his later years and provide the basis for his life's work.
